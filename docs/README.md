# JavaScript apps the monolith way

Inertia is a modern approach to building classic server-driven web apps. [They](https://inertiajs.com) call it the modern monolith.

Inertia allows you to create fully client-side rendered, single-page apps, without the complexity that comes with modern SPAs. It does this by leveraging existing server-side patterns that you already love.

Inertia has no client-side routing, nor does it require an API. Simply build route handlers and page views like you've always done! Inertia works great with any backend framework, but we've fine-tuned it for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## Not a framework

Inertia isn't a framework, nor is it a replacement for your existing server-side or client-side frameworks. Rather, it's designed to work with them. Think of Inertia as glue that connects the two. Inertia does this via adapters. They currently have three official client-side adapters (React, Vue, and Svelte). This site focuses on server-side adapters for Node.js frameworks including Hono, Express, and Koa.
