# Demo application

We've setup a demo app for Inertia.js called [Ping CRM](https://demo.inertianode.com). This application is built using Express and Vue. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/InertiaNode/PingCRM-Express-Vue).

The Ping CRM demo database is reset every hour. Please be respectful when editing data.

In addition to the Vue version of Ping CRM, we also maintain [Hono+React](https://github.com/InertiaNode/PingCRM-Hono-React) and [Koa+Svelte](https://github.com/InertiaNode/PingCRM-Koa-Svelte) versions of the application on GitHub.

## Third party

Beyond our InertiaNode demo apps, Ping CRM has also been translated into numerous different languages and frameworks. The list is available [here](https://inertiajs.com/demo-application#third-party).
